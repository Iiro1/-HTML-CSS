    <p>Sir Sadiq Khan will deliver a speech at Mansion House on Thursday evening.</p>

    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) could become "a weapon of mass destruction of jobs" if not properly controlled, Sir Sadiq Khan is set to say.

During his annual speech at Mansion House later, the mayor is due to outline his concerns about the impact of AI on the London's labour market.

He will say urgent action is needed to "seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation" and to prevent "a new era of mass unemployment".

London is "at the sharpest edge of change" because of the "colossal" impact on jobs in key sectors including finance, professional services and the creative industries, he will add.</p>
    <h2>'Mass unemployment'</h2>
    <p>The mayor's speech says AI could transform public services and tackle complex challenges like cancer care and the climate crisis, but if used recklessly, it could "usher in a new era of mass unemployment, accelerated inequality and an unprecedented concentration of wealth and power".

"We mustn't drift, absentmindedly, into a future we didn't ask for and don't want.

"We need to wake up and make a choice: seize the potential of AI and use it as a superpower for positive transformation and creation, or surrender to it and sit back and watch as it becomes a weapon of mass destruction of jobs."

Polling carried out by City Hall in November found 56% of London workers expect AI to affect their job within the next year.

Sir Sadiq believes that without intervention, roles may disappear faster than new ones are created, with entry-level jobs likely to be the first to go, "robbing our young people of that vital first step on the career ladder".

He is expected to announce a taskforce of experts from government, the skills sector and the AI industry to review the situation and assess how to support Londoners in the future.

Findings from the review are due in the summer, and Sir Sadiq will also commission free AI training for all Londoners.</p>

    <h3>'Duty to act'</h3>
    <p>The mayor adds that "we have a moral, social and economic duty to act" quickly, as research suggests 70% of skills in the average job will have changed by 2030.

A No 10 spokesperson said it was training 7.5 million workers, a fifth of the UK's entire workforce, with the essential AI skills they need over the coming years.

"In April, we'll be launching new short courses for businesses in areas like AI and digital skills to give people the tools they need for the jobs of the future," they added.

The speech comes amid growing concern over the creation of sexualised deepfake images of women and children using Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot.

X announced on Wednesday it would <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8gz8g2qnlo">prevent Grok "editing images of people in revealing clothes"</a> and block users from generating similar images of real people in countries where it is illegal.</p>
